# NMGC (Without Console)
Obviously, this is not me targeting people using console, but don't you hate when you are just randomly minding your business, or testing a new mod. AND BOOM, someone with a crown or cone just joins your lobby and spawns Travis Scott or something? well I decided to take one of the most upcoming cheater mods and just get rid of that annoying little console :)
